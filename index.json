My recent and ongoing publications explore public attitudes in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, and in the COVID and refugee crises such as policy preferences, performance evaluations of governments and the EU, including their political drivers and their electoral consequences.  Social Movements and Protest   Within the SOLID project, I am developing semi-automated solutions for protest event analysis. I have developed a pipeline for the extraction and automatic selection (using machine learning) of newswire documents for the creation of a dataset covering 30 European countries over the last six years.\n  I have published papers in the Journal of European Public Policy, Swiss Political Science Review, Quality \u0026amp; Quantity, Partecipazione e Conflitto, and collaborated in an edited book (published at Routledge) focusing on protest behavior, with a particular focus on European crises.\n  In my PhD dissertation I looked at the agenda-setting and policy impact of public claims making over time (2000-2014) and space (European democracies).In doing so, I have engaged both with investigating supply-side politics (issue positions of political parties – party manifestos, intensity of legislation in certain issue areas – comparative policy agendas) and demand-side politics (protest event analysis – automated text analysis, public opinion data – surveys and experiments), while theorizing about the links between the two.\n  Research Methods  My research within the SOLID project focuses on developing tools for the automated collection and analysis of protest event data (PEA) using text-as-data and machine learning techniques. I have been responsible for designing, collecting, and analysing several European-wide surveys (6 major surveys covering between 8 and 16 countries), all of them also comprising of survey experiments. My continued interest in social science methodology and in making user-friendly tools available to the wider research community pushed me to develop the SetMethods R package. This has by now become one of the default software options for QCA (about ~45,000 CRAN downloads, published in The R Journal - 2018). My book, co-authored with Carsten Q. Schneider and Eva Thomann, ‘Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) using R: A Gentle Introduction’ has just been published with Cambridge University Press.

For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.","tags":["R Markdown","plot","regression"],"title":"Hello R Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-473821569', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

By wrapping a paragraph in {{% callout note %}} ... {{% /callout %}}, it will render as an aside.\n{{% callout note %}} A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers. {{% /callout %}}  renders as\n A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.   Spoilers Add a spoiler to a page to reveal text, such as an answer to a question, after a button is clicked.\n{{\u0026lt; spoiler text=\u0026quot;Click to view the spoiler\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} You found me! {{\u0026lt; /spoiler \u0026gt;}}  renders as\nClick to view the spoiler You found me!\n Icons Academic enables you to use a wide range of icons from Font Awesome and Academicons in addition to emojis.\nHere are some examples using the icon shortcode to render icons:\n{{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;terminal\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fas\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Terminal {{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;python\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fab\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Python {{\u0026lt; icon name=\u0026quot;r-project\u0026quot; pack=\u0026quot;fab\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} R  renders as\n  Terminal\n Python\n R\nDid you find this page helpful?
